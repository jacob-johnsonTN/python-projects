# Python Projects
A collection of python programs I have built while learning the language. 

Program List: 

Receipt Calculator:
A program that: 
  records  user inputs (items bought, their quantity, and their price)
  adds the input to a list 
  calculates a total (including a sales tax)
  includes a conditional to apply a discount if the user spent over $100
  saves them to a file. 

Paycheck Calculator GUI:
A program that opens a GUI and:
  prompts user to name the .txt file where their inputs will be saved
  records the users first and last name
  takes input for hours worked
  takes input for rate of pay
  calculates amount to be payed
  includes conditional to pay x1.5 if user works over 40 hours
  
  Receipt GUI:
  A program similar to the Reciept Calculator but it runs in a GUI
  Dependent on a class module found in separate file (receiptclass)
    (Full disclosure: The class file was provided by my professor for the assignment where I wrote the program for the GUI)
